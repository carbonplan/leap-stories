# The ocean carbon sink

<Authors authors={['Galen McKinley', 'Amanda Fay', 'Thea Hatlen Heimdal']} />

Future climate warming depends first-and-foremost on how much humans choose to emit. But only half of the CO₂ humans added to the atmosphere between 2013 and 2022 remains there today. Multiple natural processes pull carbon out of the atmosphere and store it, with the ocean carbon sink being the most crucial. Over the course of the full industrial era, oceans have been a net sink of CO₂ from the atmosphere, reducing climate warming to just over 60% that which would’ve otherwise occurred.

Oceanographers use several methods to estimate the additional carbon that has been absorbed into the ocean in response to its growing concentration in the atmosphere, in turn due to human emissions. However, there is still a lot we don’t know about how the sink works. We rely on this climate regulation service heavily, and we have hints that the ocean sink is changing. But we don’t know enough to make accurate predictions into the future. We need to develop better ways of monitoring, measuring and understanding.

## How does the ocean carbon sink work?

The ocean carbon sink occurs due to linked physical, chemical and biological processes in the surface ocean.

CO₂ dissolves in seawater. Cold seawater can hold more CO₂ than warm water, so waters that are cooling tend to take up carbon, and waters that are warming tend to emit carbon. Since ocean waters warm when they rise to the surface in the tropical ocean and then cool as they move toward the pole, this has a strong imprint on the pattern of the global sea-to-air CO₂ flux (Figure 3, right).

The ocean is also teeming with plant life that produces organic matter from carbon extracted from the water. Much of this organic matter is quickly recycled back to dissolved carbon by the surface ocean food web, but a small portion (\<1%) of the waste matter sinks down to depth and enriches the abyss with carbon (Figure 2, left). This process moves carbon from the atmosphere, into the surface ocean, and then transports it to the deep ocean, ultimately carbon away from the atmospheric reservoir.

As humans increase the atmospheric CO₂ concentration, more carbon is driven into the oceans (Figure 2, right). This is Henry's Law<Sidenote url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law'>TK</Sidenote> – equilibration of gas between air and liquid – here operating at the global scale. Human-derived carbon is almost all in the surface ocean and slowly penetrates to depth<Sidenote>Muller paper</Sidenote> with the long timescale of ocean overturning (~1000 years).

The climate service of absorbing our excess carbon does not come for free. As water absorbs CO₂, it becomes more acidic. This has negative impacts on the health of all kinds of marine life and also chemically diminishes the ability of ocean waters to absorb even more carbon.<Cite id='doney.2020' />

    invasion of carbon into the surface ocean due to the growing atmospheric
    pCO₂ (inset on top right), and the ocean circulation that mixes
    anthropogenic carbon to depth. The total carbon cycle is the sum of the
    natural and anthropogenic cycles. At center are the observed global-mean

## How is this calculated?

We want to know how much of the carbon emitted by humans is remaining in the atmosphere, and we want to project how this balance will change in the future. To accomplish this, we need to have accurate data to estimate the ocean sink for the most recent months and years, and we need to have knowledge of how the ocean sink works so we can build simulation models for the future.

The carbon content of the ocean cannot be observed with satellites - data must be collected directly from the water. However, the ocean is enormous, covering 71% of Earth, and there are only a limited number of research ships for scientists to use to collect data. How can we get enough data to understand how much carbon is going into the whole ocean each month?

Over decades, scientists have developed machines that can automatically measure the amount of carbon dioxide in a sample of ocean water on a variety of commercial ships. With an automatic analyzer that goes unattended until the ships are in port, scientists measure the fugacity of CO₂ (fCO₂) in the surface ocean. This is a measure of the concentration of the CO₂ in the water. The exchange of CO₂ between the ocean and atmosphere at any location depends on the difference in fCO₂ concentrations between the water and the air. If the ocean has higher fCO₂, then CO₂ will come out of the ocean and if fCO₂ is lower than the atmosphere, CO₂ will go in. This exchange is called the air-sea CO₂ flux. Available measurements of fCO₂ are sparse around the ocean and are predominantly located in the northern hemisphere and along common shipping routes.

Despite decades of coordinated international efforts by ocean carbon scientists, fCO₂ observations are available for only a fraction of the vast global ocean. How do we understand the global ocean carbon sink where we do not have data? Machine Learning (ML) can be combined with full-coverage data from satellites and other sources to build full-coverage fCO₂ maps. From fCO₂, air-sea CO₂ fluxes can be calculated.

## Moving forward

From these data, and confirmed with independent approaches, it is clear that in the last several decades, the ocean has absorbed about 1 in every 4 molecules of CO₂ emitted by humans as they burn fossil fuel, clear land, and manufacture cement.<Cite id='devries.2023' /> However, many uncertainties remain. The ocean is vast and rapidly evolving. There are not many ships and buoys out there taking the needed carbon measurements. Even though know that the ocean is playing a huge role in limiting climate change, we do not have very precise understanding of how different regions of the ocean are changing their carbon uptake, and thus it is hard to say how they are likely to change in the future.<Cite id='fay.2021' />

For humans to keep global warming to less than 1.5C climate targets, at least 90% of the reductions in atmospheric pCO₂ needs to come from cutting of fossil fuel and land use emissions.<Cite id='ipcc.2022' /> On top of this, humans will need to develop systems to remove an additional 10% of CO₂ from the atmosphere. There are now many small companies pursuing technologies for “marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR)”,<Cite id='nasem.2022' /> and carbon credits from mCDR are already being sold as “carbon offsets”. Only if we build better knowledge of this huge background ocean carbon sink will we have any reasonable hope of detecting additional, much smaller local impacts from mCDR.

To address climate change, humans must collectively manage the whole global carbon cycle, and it is clear that the ocean plays an enormous role. Despite a growing understanding of the climate crisis and the critical role of the ocean in mitigating climate change, there is no long-term funded, operational system for collecting ocean carbon data and turning these into global sink estimates. Such a system<Sidenote url='https://wmo.int/activities/global-greenhouse-gas-watch-g3w'>TK</Sidenote> is urgently needed as a key component of monitoring the global carbon cycle and understanding its impacts on climate change. Though the ocean is vast and generally invisible to our daily lives, it is essential to our lives – better understanding how the ocean works is absolutely in our best interest.
