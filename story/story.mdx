# The ocean carbon sink

From 2013-2022, only half of the CO2 added to the atmosphere by humans has remained in the atmosphere; the other half has been absorbed about equally by land plants and the global oceans. Considering the full industrial era, only the oceans have been a net sink of CO2 from the atmosphere, cumulatively mitigating 37% of all human emissions; the rest of the CO2 has remained in the atmosphere to cause climate warming. If not for the ocean, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 would be about 90 ppm higher than at present. Future climate warming depends first-and-foremost on how much humans choose to emit. The future behavior of these natural sinks will also play critical roles. In this article, we explain the ocean component.

The ocean carbon sink provides a massive climate service, reducing climate warming to date and in the near future to just over 60% that which would’ve otherwise occurred. This climate service does not come for free. A natural consequence of the absorption of carbon is that the water, naturally slightly alkaline at pH ~ 8, is becoming less alkaline, or more acidic. This process is known as ‘Ocean Acidification’, and is a major concern because of negative impacts to marine life.

## How does the ocean carbon sink work?

CO2 dissolves in seawater, and then reacts with the water so that it dissociates into several ions. Cold seawater can hold more CO2 than warm water, so waters that are cooling tend to take up carbon, and waters that are upwelling and warming, such as in coastal zones and the tropics, tend to emit carbon. This contributes to the pattern of the global sea-to-air CO2 flux, as shown in this global air-sea flux map in the next section.
The ocean is also teeming with plant life that photosynthesizes in the presence of nutrients and sunlight, producing organic matter from carbon extracted from the water. Much of this organic matter is quickly recycled back to dissolved carbon by the surface ocean food web, a small portion (\<1%) of the waste matter sinks down to depth and enriches the abyss with carbon (Figure 2, left). This process moves carbon from the surface ocean to the deep ocean and stores carbon away from the atmospheric reservoir. Regionally, the high latitude oceans are highly productive, and this is another reason that high latitude oceans absorb large quantities of CO2 (flux map).

As humans increase the atmospheric CO2 concentration, more carbon is driven into the oceans (Figure 2, right). This is Henry's Law – equilibration of gas between air and liquid – here operating at the global scale. Human-derived carbon is almost all in the surface ocean and slowly penetrates to depth with the long timescale of ocean overturning (~1000 years).

## How this is calculated

How do we know how much carbon is absorbed by the ocean?

The carbon content of the ocean cannot be observed with satellites - data must be collected directly from the water. However, the ocean is enormous, covering 71% of Earth; and there are only a limited number of research ships for scientists to use to collect data. How can we get enough data to understand how much carbon is going into the whole ocean each month?

It’s impossible for scientists to go out to each location around the global oceans to collect observations. Instead, instruments have been developed that are able to measure the amount of carbon dioxide in a sample of ocean water. Specifically, scientists are looking to measure the fugacity of CO2 (fCO2) in the surface ocean, which is a measure of the concentration of the CO2 in the surface ocean waters. The exchange of CO2 between o the ocean and atmosphere at any location depends on the difference in fCO2 concentrations between the water and the air.. If the atmosphere has higher fCO2 values, then the ocean will take up CO2 in order to move closer to equilibration. This exchange s called the air-sea CO2 flux. Flux is constantly changing both seasonally and temporally and spatially, and is dependent on current conditions including wind speed as well as sea surface temperature. A positive air-sea flux value indicates the ocean is emitting carbon to the atmosphere while a negative air-sea flux value signifies ocean uptake of carbon.

Measurements of fCO2 are sparse around the ocean and are predominantly located in the northern hemisphere and along common shipping routes. This is because instruments able to measure fCO2 can be installed on container ships and scientists can monitor and obtain the measurements remotely. Additionally, fCO2 is commonly measured by research ships. Advances in technology also allow fCO2 measurements to be made on buoys and by unmanned vehicles that are deployed in the ocean. Technology is constantly advancing and it is quite possible that in the near future, fCO2 will be measurable from additional autonomous floats and even satellites!

Despite decades of coordinated international efforts by ocean carbon scientists, fCO2 observations are available for only a fraction of the vast global ocean. How do we understand the global ocean carbon sink where we do not have data? Machine Learning (ML) is now being used to extrapolate from these sparse data to build full-coverage fCO2 maps. In the training of ML algorithms, relationships are built between directly-observed fCO2 and other variables that can be measured everywhere, such as surface ocean temperature and chlorophyll from satellites. These additional variables are then used to estimate fCO2 at all points in space and time, going back several decades. From reconstructed fCO2, air-sea CO2 fluxes can be calculated; the global sum of air-sea fluxes is the ocean carbon sink.

There are other methods that are used to estimate how much carbon is going into the ocean. About once per decade, very precise data is collected from the full depth of the ocean to assess the long-term storage of excess carbon in ocean waters below the surface. Estimates for recent decades with full depth data agree with the independent air-sea flux calculations, which increases confidence in these estimates. A third approach to estimating the ocean carbon sink is to use computer simulations of the ocean circulation and carbon processes (Figure 2). Models are essential tools for scientific inquiry and are the only way to make estimates of the future ocean carbon sink. Today’s ocean models underestimate by about 10% the magnitude of the global ocean carbon sink, and have significant regional errors against observation-based air-sea flux estimates, indicating a need for model improvements.

## Discussion

Multiple approaches tell us that in the last several decades, the ocean has absorbed about 1 in every 4 molecules of CO2 emitted by humans as they burn fossil fuel, clear land, and manufacture cement. Continued careful and dedicated work by a small community of ocean carbon cycle scientists plays a key role in the closure of each year’s global carbon budget.

However, many uncertainties remain. Particularly as the scale of estimation becomes smaller in space and shorter in time, uncertainties in the carbon taken up and stored in the ocean grows. Machine learning algorithms provide consistent estimates when summed up at the scale of an ocean basin or the globe, but greater disagreement emerges at smaller scales. Ocean models are in greater disagreement at both large and small scales.

The data feeding machine learning algorithms are taken in all basins and far from shore, but these data are still very sparse. For each month of the last 40 years, only about 2% of the ocean has any recorded data. Data is particularly lacking from high latitudes in winter (of course, no one wants to go to sea then!).

Despite growing understanding of the climate crisis and the critical role of the ocean in mitigating climate change, there is no operational system for collecting ocean carbon data and turning these into global sink estimates. Instead, we depend on a handful of scientists who volunteer their nights and weekends. This is a fragile system that could fail at any time, and if it does, we would lose our current ability to track the progress of the ocean carbon sink. To address climate change, humans must collectively manage the whole global carbon cycle in which the ocean plays an enormous role. A robust, long-term approach for ocean carbon observing and sink estimation is badly needed.

This massive global ocean carbon sink occurs as a natural response to human CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. In the last few years, it has been proposed that humans might create engineered systems to enhance the ocean’s carbon uptake. There are now many small companies pursuing technologies for “marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR)”, and carbon credits from mCDR are already being sold as “carbon offsets”. But how will we quantify engineered effects when the huge background sink, as described here, is itself insufficiently quantified, particularly at small spatial scales? The problems with credits for carbon going into forests got a lot of attention in 2023. With mCDR, these challenges are perhaps even larger. The oceans are huge and difficult to access. To attribute change in carbon stocks on land and in soils to human carbon engineering has proven to be very difficult - but at least the land stays in the same place from year to year. In contrast, the ocean is constantly in motion - making it very difficult to measure “the same patch” repeatedly. The mCDR industry is rapidly growing, but it remains to be seen if sufficient measurement and modeling approaches can be developed to demonstrate additional carbon uptake is actually occurring.

Engineered solutions such as mCDR are projected by the IPCC to be able to fulfill no more than 10% of the reductions in atmospheric CO2 required to achieve 1.5C climate targets. This means that 90% of the reductions in atmospheric CO2 will have to come from reductions in human emissions. The ocean sink will change in rough proportion to human emissions. As emissions are reduced, the ocean sink will get smaller in absolute magnitude; however, the ocean will absorb a greater fraction of human emissions (see Box).

Put Bathtub Analogy in a Box?: If we think of emissions of carbon as the flow of water into a bathtub. The ocean sink is a drain that can remove 25% of this flow. The atmosphere CO₂ is the water remaining in the bathtub. Because more water is going in than is flowing out, the level of the water keeps going up. Now, if we reduce the flow into the bathtub, the ocean “drain” can take up a greater percent of this inflow, even though the total rate of outflow will be less.

Effectively managing the global carbon cycle is essential for limiting dangerous levels of climate warming. There is no doubt that the ocean fundamentally modifies the relationship between CO2 emissions and climate warming, but we cannot accurately track change in the ocean carbon sink, and we are yet unable to quantify additional uptake caused by new engineering approaches. Without enough data and knowledge, we cannot rule out surprises. Though it often seems far away, the ocean carbon cycle plays a huge role in the climate that we experience – keeping better tabs on it would be in our best interest.
