# The ocean carbon sink

<Authors authors={['Galen McKinley', 'Amanda Fay', 'Thea Hatlen Heimdal']} />

From 2013-2022, only half of the CO₂ added to the atmosphere by humans has remained in the atmosphere; the other half has been absorbed about equally by land plants and the global oceans. Considering the full industrial era, only the oceans have been a net sink of CO₂ from the atmosphere, cumulatively mitigating 37% of all human emissions; the rest of the CO₂ has remained in the atmosphere to cause climate warming.<Cite id='friedlingstein.2023' />

Future climate warming depends first-and-foremost on how much humans choose to emit. The future behavior of these natural sinks will also play critical roles. In this article, we explain the ocean component.

The ocean carbon sink provides a massive climate service, reducing climate warming to just over 60% that which would’ve otherwise occurred. However, this climate service does not come for free. A natural consequence of the absorption of carbon is that the water, naturally slightly alkaline at pH ~ 8, is becoming less alkaline, or more acidic. This process is known as ‘Ocean Acidification’, and is a major concern because of negative impacts to marine life.<Cite id='doney.2020' />

## How does the ocean carbon sink work?

CO₂ dissolves in seawater. Cold seawater can hold more CO₂ than warm water, so waters that are cooling tend to take up carbon, and waters that are warming tend to emit carbon. This contributes to the pattern of the global sea-to-air CO₂ flux, as shown in this global air-sea flux map in the next section.

The ocean is also teeming with plant life that produces organic matter from carbon extracted from the water. Much of this organic matter is quickly recycled back to dissolved carbon by the surface ocean food web, but a small portion (\<1%) of the waste matter sinks down to depth and enriches the abyss with carbon (Figure 2, left). This process moves carbon from the atmosphere, into the surface ocean, and then transports it to the deep ocean, ultimately carbon away from the atmospheric reservoir. Regionally, the high latitude oceans are highly productive, and this is another reason that high latitude oceans absorb large quantities of CO₂ (flux map).

As humans increase the atmospheric CO₂ concentration, more carbon is driven into the oceans (Figure 2, right). This is Henry's Law<Sidenote url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law'>TK</Sidenote> – equilibration of gas between air and liquid – here operating at the global scale. Human-derived carbon is almost all in the surface ocean and slowly penetrates to depth<Sidenote>Muller paper</Sidenote> with the long timescale of ocean overturning (~1000 years).

    anthropogenic carbon to depth. The total carbon cycle is the sum of the

## How this is calculated

How do we know how much carbon is absorbed by the ocean?

The carbon content of the ocean cannot be observed with satellites - data must be collected directly from the water. However, the ocean is enormous, covering 71% of Earth, and there are only a limited number of research ships for scientists to use to collect data. How can we get enough data to understand how much carbon is going into the whole ocean each month?

It’s impossible for scientists to go out to each location to collect observations. Instead, instruments have been developed that are able to measure the amount of carbon dioxide in a sample of ocean water. Specifically, scientists measure the fugacity of CO₂ (fCO₂) in the surface ocean, which is a measure of the concentration of the CO₂ in the surface ocean waters. The exchange of CO₂ between the ocean and atmosphere at any location depends on the difference in fCO₂ concentrations between the water and the air. If the atmosphere has higher fCO₂ values, then the ocean will take up CO₂ in order to move closer to equilibration. This exchange is called the air-sea CO₂ flux. A positive air-sea flux value indicates the ocean is emitting carbon to the atmosphere while a negative air-sea flux value signifies ocean uptake of carbon.

Available measurements of fCO₂ are sparse around the ocean and are predominantly located in the northern hemisphere and along common shipping routes. Many data come from automated instruments installed on commercial ships. fCO₂ measurements are also being made on buoys and unmanned vehicles that are particularly good for accessing remote and inhospitable ocean regions.

Despite decades of coordinated international efforts by ocean carbon scientists, fCO₂ observations are available for only a fraction of the vast global ocean. How do we understand the global ocean carbon sink where we do not have data? Machine Learning (ML) can be combined with full-coverage data from satellites and other sources to build full-coverage fCO₂ maps. From fCO₂, air-sea CO₂ fluxes can be calculated.

There are two other methods that are used to estimate how much carbon is going into the ocean.

One method is to use very precise data collected from the full depth of the ocean to assess the long-term storage of excess carbon below the surface.<Sidenote>Muller paper and / or RECCAP paper</Sidenote> Estimates of the carbon sink for recent decades using full depth data agree with machine learning based estimates,<Cite id='fay.2021' /> which increases confidence in both approaches.

The final approach to estimating the ocean carbon sink is to use computer simulations of the ocean circulation and carbon processes (Figure 2). Models are essential tools for scientific inquiry and are the only way to make estimates of the future ocean carbon sink. Models capture many features of the ocean carbon cycle, but more work is needed to enhance their accuracy.<Cite id='fay.2021' />

## Discussion

Multiple approaches tell us that in the last several decades, the ocean has absorbed about 1 in every 4 molecules of CO₂ emitted by humans as they burn fossil fuel, clear land, and manufacture cement.<Cite id='friedlingstein.2023' />

However, many uncertainties remain. Particularly as the scale of estimation becomes smaller in space and shorter in time, uncertainties in the amount of carbon taken up and stored in the ocean grows. Machine learning algorithms provide consistent estimates when summed up at the scale of an ocean basin or the globe, but greater disagreement between methods emerges at smaller scales. Ocean models also show disagreement at both large and small scales.<Cite id='fay.2021' />

For humans to keep global warming to less than 1.5C climate targets, at least 90% of the reductions in atmospheric pCO₂ needs to come from cutting of fossil fuel and land use emissions.<Cite id='ipcc.2022' /> On top of this, humans will need to develop systems to remove an additional 10% of CO₂ from the atmosphere. There are now many small companies pursuing technologies for “marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR)”,<Cite id='nasem.2022' /> and carbon credits from mCDR are already being sold as “carbon offsets”. But how will we quantify engineered effects when the huge background sink, as described here, is itself insufficiently quantified, particularly at small spatial scales? A lot of work must be done to be able to know if mCDR technologies are actually causing the ocean to take up more carbon.

To address climate change, humans must collectively manage the whole global carbon cycle, and it is clear that the ocean plays an enormous role. Despite a growing understanding of the climate crisis and the critical role of the ocean in mitigating climate change, there is no long-term funded, operational system for collecting ocean carbon data and turning these into global sink estimates. Such a system<Sidenote url='https://wmo.int/activities/global-greenhouse-gas-watch-g3w'>TK</Sidenote> is urgently needed as a key component of monitoring the global carbon cycle and understanding its impacts on climate change.

Effectively managing the global carbon cycle is essential for limiting dangerous levels of climate warming. There is no doubt that the ocean fundamentally modifies the relationship between CO₂ emissions and climate warming, but we cannot accurately track change in the ocean carbon sink, and we are yet unable to quantify additional uptake caused by new engineering approaches. Without enough data and knowledge, we cannot rule out surprises. Though it often seems far away, the ocean carbon cycle plays a huge role in the climate that we experience – keeping better tabs on it will be in our best interest.
